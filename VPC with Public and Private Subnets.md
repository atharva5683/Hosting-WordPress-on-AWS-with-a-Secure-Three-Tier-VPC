# Create VPC with Public and Private Subnets

We will construct a custom VPC to begin the project; the three-tiered enabled reference architecture for the VPC is shown below.
A public subnet housing a NAT gateway, bastion host, and loadbalancer is found in the first tier of a three-tier virtual private cloud reference architecture. The web servers (EC2 instances) are housed in a private subnet on the second tier, while the database is contained in a private subnet on the third tier. To offer high availability and fault tolerance, all of these subnets are replicated across various availability zones. Lastly, we will build an internet gateway and route table, which will enable the vpc's resources to be connected to the internet.
